## Automation intents for Tasker and ADB

This fork adds an optional automation interface that can control enabled Web Apps through Android broadcast intents. It is intended for local automation tools such as Tasker or for debugging through ADB.

Automation is disabled by default.

### Security warning

Automation intents can control a Web App that may already be logged in to a website. Depending on the command, automation can zoom, scroll, execute JavaScript, inspect visible DOM text, and click page elements.

Only enable automation for Web Apps you intend to control. Anyone who knows the configured automation passcode and can send intents on the device may be able to control automation-enabled Web Apps.

### Setup

1. Open Native Alpha settings.
2. Set a global **Automation passcode**.
3. Open the target Web App settings.
4. Enable **Allow automation intents** for that Web App.
5. Make sure the Web App is not using a sandbox/container. Sandbox/container routing is not implemented for automation commands.
6. For `run_js`, `find_text`, and `click_text`, make sure JavaScript is enabled for the Web App.

### Broadcast target

Use this broadcast action:

```text
com.cylonid.nativealpha.action.AUTOMATION_COMMAND
```

Release build component:

```text
Package: com.cylonid.nativealpha
Class:   com.cylonid.nativealpha.automation.AutomationCommandReceiver
Target:  Broadcast Receiver
```

Debug build component:

```text
Package: com.cylonid.nativealpha.debug
Class:   com.cylonid.nativealpha.automation.AutomationCommandReceiver
Target:  Broadcast Receiver
```

### Recommended Tasker usage

Tasker's **Send Intent** action has a small number of extra fields, so the recommended format is to send one JSON payload extra:

```text
automation_payload:{...}
```

Tasker Send Intent example:

```text
Action:
com.cylonid.nativealpha.action.AUTOMATION_COMMAND

Extra:
automation_payload:{"automation_command":"scroll_by","webappID":0,"automation_passcode":"PASSCODE","request_id":"scroll_800_001","result_broadcast_action":"com.example.tasker.NATIVE_ALPHA_RESULT","dx":0,"dy":800,"scroll_unit":"px"}

Package:
com.cylonid.nativealpha.debug

Class:
com.cylonid.nativealpha.automation.AutomationCommandReceiver

Target:
Broadcast Receiver
```

For release builds, change the package to:

```text
com.cylonid.nativealpha
```

### Result broadcasts

If `result_broadcast_action` is included in the payload, Native Alpha broadcasts the command result to that action.

Example result action:

```text
com.example.tasker.NATIVE_ALPHA_RESULT
```

Tasker can listen for that action with an Event Profile and read these extras:

```text
request_id
automation_command
webappID
ok
status
error_code
error_message
json_result
```

`json_result` contains command-specific data, such as scroll positions, zoom status, or matched text coordinates.

### Common payload fields

Every command should include:

```json
{
  "automation_command": "COMMAND_NAME",
  "automation_passcode": "PASSCODE",
  "request_id": "unique_request_id",
  "result_broadcast_action": "com.example.tasker.NATIVE_ALPHA_RESULT"
}
```

To target a specific Web App, include:

```json
"webappID": 0
```

If `webappID` is provided and the Web App is not active, Native Alpha attempts to launch it and then run the command once the WebView is ready.

If `webappID` is omitted, the command targets the currently active Web App. If no Web App is active, the command fails with:

```text
activity_not_active
```

### Supported commands

#### `scroll_by`

Scrolls the native WebView by pixels or viewport units.

Scroll down 800 pixels:

```json
{
  "automation_command": "scroll_by",
  "webappID": 0,
  "automation_passcode": "PASSCODE",
  "request_id": "scroll_800_001",
  "result_broadcast_action": "com.example.tasker.NATIVE_ALPHA_RESULT",
  "dx": 0,
  "dy": 800,
  "scroll_unit": "px"
}
```

Scroll down one viewport:

```json
{
  "automation_command": "scroll_by",
  "webappID": 0,
  "automation_passcode": "PASSCODE",
  "request_id": "scroll_viewport_001",
  "result_broadcast_action": "com.example.tasker.NATIVE_ALPHA_RESULT",
  "dx": 0,
  "dy": 1.0,
  "scroll_unit": "viewport"
}
```

`scroll_unit` may be:

```text
px
viewport
```

For viewport units, `dy:1.0` means one WebView height, and `dx:1.0` means one WebView width.

#### `scroll_to`

Scrolls the native WebView to a target position.

```json
{
  "automation_command": "scroll_to",
  "webappID": 0,
  "automation_passcode": "PASSCODE",
  "request_id": "scroll_to_top_001",
  "result_broadcast_action": "com.example.tasker.NATIVE_ALPHA_RESULT",
  "x": 0,
  "y": 0,
  "scroll_unit": "px"
}
```

#### `zoom_in`

Zooms in one native WebView step.

```json
{
  "automation_command": "zoom_in",
  "webappID": 0,
  "automation_passcode": "PASSCODE",
  "request_id": "zoom_in_001",
  "result_broadcast_action": "com.example.tasker.NATIVE_ALPHA_RESULT"
}
```

#### `zoom_out`

Zooms out one native WebView step.

```json
{
  "automation_command": "zoom_out",
  "webappID": 0,
  "automation_passcode": "PASSCODE",
  "request_id": "zoom_out_001",
  "result_broadcast_action": "com.example.tasker.NATIVE_ALPHA_RESULT"
}
```

#### `zoom_by`

Applies a relative zoom factor.

Example: zoom by 150% relative to the current zoom level:

```json
{
  "automation_command": "zoom_by",
  "webappID": 0,
  "automation_passcode": "PASSCODE",
  "request_id": "zoom_150_001",
  "result_broadcast_action": "com.example.tasker.NATIVE_ALPHA_RESULT",
  "zoom_factor": 1.5
}
```

Example: zoom out to 80% of the current zoom level:

```json
{
  "automation_command": "zoom_by",
  "webappID": 0,
  "automation_passcode": "PASSCODE",
  "request_id": "zoom_080_001",
  "result_broadcast_action": "com.example.tasker.NATIVE_ALPHA_RESULT",
  "zoom_factor": 0.8
}
```

`zoom_by` is relative. It does not set an absolute page zoom percentage.

#### `run_js`

Runs arbitrary JavaScript in the target WebView.

```json
{
  "automation_command": "run_js",
  "webappID": 0,
  "automation_passcode": "PASSCODE",
  "request_id": "js_outline_001",
  "result_broadcast_action": "com.example.tasker.NATIVE_ALPHA_RESULT",
  "js": "document.body.style.outline='3px solid red';"
}
```

`run_js` is fire-and-forget. The result broadcast only reports whether JavaScript was dispatched to the WebView. It does not return the JavaScript result.

The JavaScript payload is limited to 64 KB.

#### `find_text`

Finds the first visible exact text match in DOM order.

```json
{
  "automation_command": "find_text",
  "webappID": 0,
  "automation_passcode": "PASSCODE",
  "request_id": "find_continue_001",
  "result_broadcast_action": "com.example.tasker.NATIVE_ALPHA_RESULT",
  "text": "Continue"
}
```

The result may include the matched element tag, text, rectangle, viewport information, and approximate WebView/screen coordinates in `json_result`.

Matching behavior:

```text
Exact visible text only
First match in DOM order
Whitespace is normalized
```

#### `click_text`

Finds the first visible exact text match in DOM order and clicks the element containing that text.

```json
{
  "automation_command": "click_text",
  "webappID": 0,
  "automation_passcode": "PASSCODE",
  "request_id": "click_continue_001",
  "result_broadcast_action": "com.example.tasker.NATIVE_ALPHA_RESULT",
  "text": "Continue",
  "scroll_into_view": true
}
```

`click_text` performs a DOM-level click on the matching element itself. It does not search for a clickable parent element.

### ADB examples

Linux/macOS example, scroll down 800 pixels:

```bash
adb shell am broadcast \
  -a com.cylonid.nativealpha.action.AUTOMATION_COMMAND \
  -n com.cylonid.nativealpha.debug/com.cylonid.nativealpha.automation.AutomationCommandReceiver \
  --es automation_payload '{"automation_command":"scroll_by","webappID":0,"automation_passcode":"PASSCODE","request_id":"scroll_800_001","result_broadcast_action":"com.example.tasker.NATIVE_ALPHA_RESULT","dx":0,"dy":800,"scroll_unit":"px"}'
```

Windows PowerShell example, zoom by 150% relative:

```powershell
adb shell "am broadcast -a com.cylonid.nativealpha.action.AUTOMATION_COMMAND -n com.cylonid.nativealpha.debug/com.cylonid.nativealpha.automation.AutomationCommandReceiver --es automation_payload '{`"automation_command`":`"zoom_by`",`"webappID`":0,`"automation_passcode`":`"PASSCODE`",`"request_id`":`"zoom_150_001`",`"result_broadcast_action`":`"com.example.tasker.NATIVE_ALPHA_RESULT`",`"zoom_factor`":1.5}'"
```

For release builds, replace:

```text
com.cylonid.nativealpha.debug/com.cylonid.nativealpha.automation.AutomationCommandReceiver
```

with:

```text
com.cylonid.nativealpha/com.cylonid.nativealpha.automation.AutomationCommandReceiver
```

### Known limitations

Automation does not support sandbox/container Web Apps.

`run_js`, `find_text`, and `click_text` require JavaScript to be enabled for the target Web App.

`find_text` and `click_text` operate on the regular DOM. They may not work for text rendered in canvas, images, cross-origin iframes, closed shadow roots, or virtualized content that has not been rendered yet.

`click_text` uses a DOM-level click. Some websites require trusted user gestures and may ignore synthetic DOM clicks.

The automation passcode is intended as a local control guard, not as a strong security boundary.

## FAQ
<details> 
<summary><i> Q: Why would I need this app if any mobile browser can do the same? </i></summary>
A: Mobile browsers usually only are able to create shortcuts which give a native, borderless fullscreen experience if the website has a Progressive Web App (PWA) manifest. Unfortunately, most websites do not offer this feature yet. Additionally, you cannot set different settings for different websites with an usual browser.
</details>

<details> 
<summary><i> Q: Can I keep multiple log-in sessions of the same website? </i></summary>
A: Yes, this is possible using the sandbox feature of Native Alpha Plus.
</details>

<details> 
<summary><i> Q: Why isn't the sandbox feature in Native Alpha Plus enabled by default? </i></summary>
A: The sandboxing approach is recommended for specific usage rather than general usage because it can limit the performance of the application and increase the disk usage. Therefore, use it for privacy-invasive websites or websites where you want to be logged in twice, but not for any website just because you can.
</details>

<details> 
<summary><i> Q: Is this app a dedicated web browser with its own browser engine? </i></summary>
A: No. As stated, this app relies on the system built-in Android WebView in order to display the website. For privacy reasons, you can opt to use alternative webviews such as [Bromite](https://www.bromite.org/system_web_view) on rooted phones. Always make sure to use to most recent version of any WebView implementation you use!
</details>

<details>
<summary><i> Q: Why is it not possible to find an icon for a certain website? </i></summary>
A: This problem can occur due to multiple reasons. In most cases, the website does not offer a high-resolution icon. If you are a website maintainer and your website icon cannot be found, look at [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net) for further information. If you think it should work, feel free to post the URL and I will look into it.
</details>

<details>
<summary><i> Q: In constrast to your promise, this app has a large memory footprint! </i></summary>
A: This is because Native Alpha makes use of caching in the same way your browser app does, i.e., it saves web content locally on your device. Then it can be loaded faster if you visit the same page again. You can either delete cache regularly yourself or set the "Clear cache after usage" setting in the global settings if memory footprint is a concern for you. However, then websites will take a longer time to load because everything has to be loaded from net.
</details>

<details>
<summary><i> Q: What is the minimum Android version for running Native Alpha? </i></summary>
A: Android 9 and newer are supported.
</details>

<details>
<summary><i> Q: I don't want to use Google Play services, is there any other way to obtain Native Alpha Plus? </i></summary>
A: You can build the app yourself, everything is open-source including the paid features. Also, the GitHub release includes the Pro features.
